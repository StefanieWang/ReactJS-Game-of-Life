# ReactJS Game Of Life 

[The Game of Life is an example of a cellular automaton](https://www.math.cornell.edu/~lipa/mec/lesson6.html). 

In this react game of life:

1. When user first arrives at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.

2. User can start and stop the board.

3. User can set up the board.

4. User can clear the board.

5. When user presses start, the game will play out.

6. Each time the board changes, user can see how many generations have gone by.

7. The game can be run step by step by clicking the "step" button, 
so user can observe how cells become alive and dead in each generation.

8. User can choose from 3 different sim speed to make the game run slower or faster.

9. User can add cells any time ( whether game is running or stopped ) by clicking on the empty squares on the board.

10. User can investigate the evolution of some simplest patterns and can even choose a randomly generated board of cells,
however speed may be slower with a large board.
